# Part A: Training from scratch

Here I implement a 5 layer CNN network from scratch using PyTorch library and train it using inaturalist dataset. <br>

This file contains the code of the CNN architecture and training it using our dataset. <br>
The file has been trained in Google Colab/Kaggle where I have uploaded the dataset. <br>
